      <p><strong>Cold Wallet Tips &amp; Suggestions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suggestions</strong>:
As everyone has become accustomed to these days, cryptocurrency remains one of the safest methods for storing and spending money. As the market heats up, it&rsquo;s crucial to be prepared for the next bull run. However, with the increasing money and activity, there will inevitably be bad actors looking to exploit vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>I witnessed firsthand when my friend, who was a developer for Harmony, was hacked for around $800k. The hackers found a way to exploit the extension, even though it functioned similarly to MetaMask. In this case, the hackers didn&rsquo;t need the seed to gain access to the wallet.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also heard and read countless reports of people being hacked, resulting in drained wallets. The primary culprit?</p>
<p><strong>HUMAN ERROR</strong></p>
<p>To avoid these pitfalls, follow these guidelines and never make these common mistakes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Keep your seed safe</strong>: Your 12/24-word seed is your ultimate access code. Store it only on a piece of paper or a metal plate – no photos, no computer files. This seed is your key to everything, whether you use a hardware wallet or a paper wallet. Keep it safe and never disclose it to anyone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use a separate browser for trading</strong>: Avoid using your trading browser for daily activities, especially anything shady. Hackers may find a way through cookies, gaining access to your unlocked MetaMask. Use a dedicated browser like Firefox solely for trading. Bookmark essential websites and keep this browser updated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider a separate computer</strong>: The more separated your personal life is from your crypto life, the better. Using a dedicated computer for trading adds an extra layer of security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid clicking on unfamiliar links</strong>: Never click on any links within the trading profile, computer, or browser. You can never be certain if a person or website is compromised. Bookmark important websites to minimize the risk of falling for phishing attempts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Securely handle your seed on the computer</strong>: If you must use your seed on a computer, change the wallet immediately and transfer your funds to a new, clean wallet.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Cold Wallet Suggestions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Coldcard Mk4: Arguably the best Bitcoin hardware wallet, completely air-gapped, eliminating the need to connect to a computer. It only requires a battery and a microSD card. Keep in mind that it is designed for Bitcoin storage, not for daily usage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trezor: An extremely user-friendly hardware wallet, suitable for daily transactions. While I still use the Trezor One, the Trezor Safe 3 is considered a bit more secure in case your Trezor gets stolen.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other alternatives like Ledger and Jade, but due to numerous hacking stories surrounding Ledger, it may not be the safest option. I personally prefer Coldcard over Jade.</p>
