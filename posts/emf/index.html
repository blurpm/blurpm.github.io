<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078T2R64C" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078T2R64C</a> TriField EMF Meter Model TF2
One of the best EMF meter for non professional work. It has standard, weighted and RF settings and battery lasts really long. It is always best to measure than guess.</p>

<li>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08FRPKNQL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08FRPKNQL</a> EMF blackout Beanie
Protecting head is beyond all. You can get same type of clothing as well, but I would get this beanie immediately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B01N4LJOE2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B01N4LJOE2</a> EMF blocked Earbuds. Defendershield is one of the best in this field in terms of EMF blockage and sound quality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ball mouse: Basic B100 logitech mouse is also great if you dont want to use ball mouse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simple wired keyboard: proHT 107 key usb keyboard is great.</p>
</li>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/products/B09B765MN1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.amazon.com/dp/products/B09B765MN1</a> Grounded bed sheet. There are cheaper alternatives on aliexpress as well.</p>

<h3 id="protection-tips">Protection Tips <a href="#protection-tips" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><ul>
<li>
<p>You can have a simple timer plug for modem, so that it will shut down at nights. If you cannot do that simply disable Wi-Fi, at least when you are sleeping.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep your cell phone on airplane mode when not using.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep your cell phone on 3G. 5G is deadlies them all, 4G is not good either. 3G is the safest, and I am sure you wont need that extra speed with your phone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you need to make a call, do not place your phone to your ear more than a minute a day. Better use headphones with EMF blockage or speaker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to hard wire all of your appliances, including your office computer internet, mouse and keyboard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid all wireless devices including baby monitor, wireless watches, fitness devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unplug appliences when you are sleeping if they are in the sleeping area. They will emit great amount of EMF while plugged in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to use EMF shielding blankets or bed canopies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to be far from microwave when it is working.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not use your laptop on your legs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get Vitamin A, C, D, Zinc, Magnesium, Melatonin, reishi mushroom, iodine.</p>
</li>
</ul>
