      <description>My personal suggestions and usage for home network. ðŸ”—Insurgo laptop with Qubes OS
 Trading: Has only firefox installed with metamask. All important links are already bookmarked. It goes through Tor + VPN (dedicated IP) so that I don&amp;rsquo;t always see captcha errors. Vault: All my licenses, passwords, and everything is stored here, with no internet connection. Even if this is compromised, there is no problem as I use 2fa for all critical accounts.</description>
